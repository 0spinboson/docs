Customising Bootstrapping
=========================

Whilst Bolt is designed to be simple for anyone to install, its core
functionality is also modular and easy to configure for developers who are
comfortable making a few modifications to how Bolt is bootstrapped.

The basics of configuring a Bolt application
--------------------------------------------

There are two ways your Bolt application is used, via web requests and via
the command line with nut. Because there are two entry points, bootstrap
configuration/customization needs to be done in a standard place.

This is with a configuration file in the root directory of your project.
This file can be either `.bolt.yml` or `.bolt.php`.
With this file you can modify things like paths, the application class to use,
add other services used by the application, and add custom extensions.

Bolt looks for `.bolt.yml` first, then `.bolt.php`. The YAML file is recommended,
but PHP can be used if programmatic logic is required.

Customising file system paths
-----------------------------

Below are full examples of all available paths customised.

### Example 1a. YAML `.bolt.yml` file

```yaml
paths:
    cache: %app%/cache
    config: %app%/config
    database: %app%/database
    extensions: %site%/extensions
    extensions_config: %config%/extensions
    web: %site%/public
    files: %web%/files
    themes: %web%/theme
    bolt_assets: %web%/bolt-public
```

### Example 1b. PHP `.bolt.php` file

```php
<?php

return [
    'paths' => [
        'cache'             => '%app%/cache',
        'config'            => '%app%/config',
        'database'          => '%app%/database',
        'extensions'        => '%site%/extensions',
        'extensions_config' => '%config%/extensions',
        'web'               => '%site%/public',
        'files'             => '%web%/files',
        'themes'            => '%web%/theme',
        'bolt_assets'       => '%web%/bolt-public/view',
    ],
];
```


Adding your own service providers
---------------------------------

Adding your own service provider gives a lot of scope to add your own services
or replace/[extend][] any existing service.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Bolt does call Composer's autoloader
before this file, but it is up to you to configure <code>composer.json</code>
to autoload these classes.</p>

```yaml
# .bolt.yml
services:
    - MyApp\Provider\CustomProvider
```

```php
<?php // .bolt.php

return [
    'services' => [
        MyApp\Provider\CustomProvider::class
        // or
        new MyApp\Provider\CustomProvider()
    ]
];
```


Custom Application Class
------------------------

The Application class can be changed here as well. This allows you to modify
Bolt services or add your own, although using the `services` described above
is recommended instead.

In YAML, you can give the class name and we will create it for you. We will
still apply any other customization afterwards as well.

```yaml
application: My\Application
```

In PHP, you can give the class name...

```php
<?php

return [
    'application' => My\Application::class,
];
```

For even more flexibly you can create the application yourself, or pull it in
from another bootstrap file you have. Itâ€™s important to note here that if you
give us an application _object_ we'll assume it is ready to go. This means you
will need to apply any other customizations yourself.

```php
<?php

// Create the application.
$app = new My\Application();

return [
    'application' => $app
];

// You can also just return the application object as a shortcut
return $app;
```

Mounting Bolt on an existing application
----------------------------------------

A lot of work has been done on the internals of Bolt which allow it now to run
as a self- contained `HTTPKernelInterface` application without interfering with
any of the global namespace or constants. So if you use [StackPHP] (or similar)
you can mount Bolt onto a URL prefix as simply as this:

```php
// Assuming this is in public/index.php and Bolt is located in vendor/bolt/bolt/
$map = [
    '/another' => new AnotherApplication(),
    '/blog'    => require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/bolt/bolt/app/bootstrap.php'
];
$app = (new Stack\Builder())
    ->push('Stack\UrlMap', $map)
    ->resolve($app);

Stack\run($app);
```

This means that you can, for instance, use Bolt to manage one specific part of
a larger application set.
