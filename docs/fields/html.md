HTML field
==========

A WYSIWYG HTML field. You can supply extra options to it to customize the
behaviour and appearance.

## Basic Configuration:

```yaml
        content:
            type: html
```

## Example usage in templates:

To print out the HTML field you just need to do in your templates:

```twig
{{ record.content }}
```

## Options:

The field has a few options to change the appearance and functionality of the
field.

* `allowtwig` can be set to true or false to control if twig may be used in the
  field
* `options` contains the options for the <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr>
  editor. See below for an example and the [CKEditor API][ckeditor] for more
  information on possible options:

```yaml
        content:
            type: html
            options:
                ckeditor:
                    entities: true # this enables special characters to be stored as their HTML entity
                    entities_latin: true # this enables Latin characters to be stored as their HTML entity - eg when true, Â£ is stored as &pound;
                    height: 400
                    autoGrow_maxHeight: 400
                    autoGrow_onStartup: false
                    uiColor: '#BADA55'
                    autoGrow_minHeight: 300
```
