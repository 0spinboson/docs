About Bolt
==========

Bolt is a CMS, which strives to be as simple and straightforward as possible.
It is quick to set up, easy to configure, uses elegant templates, and above all: it's a joy to use.

It is made using modern Open Source libraries, and is best suited to build sites in HTML5 with
modern markup.

Bolt is created for:

 - **End users** (read 'editors') that focus on producing and editing
   content.
 - **Front-end developers / designers** who want to set up websites where the CMS is
  flexible and easy to implement.
 - **Developers** who need a system that's easy to manage, flexible and versatile.
