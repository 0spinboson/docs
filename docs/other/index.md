=========================

Bolt is run by a dedicated community, which is active on several different
locations on the internet. If you couldn't find the information you needed in
these docs, be sure to get in touch, using one of the following ways:

  - Major news will always be announced on our main website:
    [Bolt.cm](https://bolt.cm).

  - The official documentation has a lot of information. Have you tried
    searching? The search box is in the upper right corner. If you're missing
    something in the docs, or if you've spotted an error: Please let us know on
    our [Github tracker for documentation](https://github.com/bolt/bolt-
    docs/issues).

  - We're active on Twitter. Follow us, or say hello at
    [@BoltCM](https://twitter.com/boltcm).

  - You can post questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com). Be
    sure to tag them with [bolt-cms](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged
    /bolt-cms), and we'll gladly help you out.

  - For (potential) bugs and feature requests, open an issue on our [Github
    Issue Tracker](http://github.com/bolt/bolt/issues). Pull-requests are
    always welcome, as well.

  - Look for small snippets of code and some tips & tricks or our [Snippets
    website](https://snippets.bolt.cm). It's like Pastebin, only powered by
    Bolt.

  - We have some pages with detailed information on a couple of subjects on the
    wiki at [github.com/bolt/bolt/wiki](https://github.com/bolt/bolt/wiki).

  - There's always some people willing to chat in our IRC channel on Freenode
    at #boltcms. No IRC client? Use the embedded IRC on
    [our website here](https://bolt.cm/irc), or [IRCcloud](http://irccloud.com).

Finally, if you're using Bolt in your company, and you need commercial support,
feel free to get in touch with Two Kings. Two Kings is the Netherlands based
webdevelopment company that's spearheading the ongoing development of Bolt, and
as such they will ensure continuity for the project. For commercial offers
only: get in touch with
[commercialsupport@bolt.cm](mailto:commercialsupport@bolt.cm) or
[support@twokings.nl](mailto:support@twokings.nl).
