============

Request caching is way to provide a performance boost on some site pages,
providing faster page loading. Request caching also means less work for the web
server to do in order to serve the requested page repeatedly over a period of
of time.

<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Incorrectly configured request
caching can cause numerous unexpected side effects, especially with dynamic or
session based data.
