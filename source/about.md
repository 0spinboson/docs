About Bolt
==========

Bolt is a tool for Content Management, which strives to be as simple and straightforward as possible. It is quick to set
up, easy to configure, uses elegant templates, and above all: It's a joy to use. Bolt is created using modern Open
Source libraries, and is best suited to build sites in HTML5, with modern markup.

Basically, there are three groups of users we've created Bolt for:

 - End users (read 'editors') that want to focus on producing and editing content, and not on clicking buttons in the
   CMS.
 - Front-end designers and developers who like to write clean markup, and who want to build websites where the CMS
   doesn't dictate what the templates or site should look like.
 - Developers who need a system that's easy to set up and configure, that's easy to manage and maintain, but is also
   flexible and versatile.

Using Bolt as a content editor: you don't have to know anything about HTML, CSS, PHP or any of the other technical stuff
we used to build Bolt. Using Bolt should be about writing and editing content, so that's the focus of Bolt's user
interface. Far more information about how Bolt works can be found in the chapter [Using Bolt](/using).

Building a website with Bolt: we assume you have the usual Frontender skills. You know HTML/CSS, and have working
knowledge about JavaScript so you can implement things like Google Analytics trackers, jQuery plugins and such. To
create a working site out of your static HTML, you'll need to know about how Bolt uses Content and Contenttypes, and how
to make templates using Twig. Information about those topics can be found in the chapters [Working with Content and
Content types](/content) and [Building templates](/templates).

Creating Bolt we wanted to focus on creating something simple, straightforward and enjoyable. If you need to build a
site with 'enterprise' features, you'll quickly find that there are better tools. The team behind Bolt is working on
Pivot 4, which will be awesome. And otherwise you might look into Drupal or Expression Engine. If, however, you need to
build a site without a billion modules or huge datastructures, nothing beats Bolt for ease of use.
