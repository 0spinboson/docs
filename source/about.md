Pilex 
=====

Pilex is a small CMS, which strives to be as simple and straightforward as possible. It is quick to set up, easy to configure, uses elegant templates, and above all: It's a joy to use. Pilex is created using modern Open Source libraries, and is best suited to build sites in HTML5, with modern markup.

Who did we create Pilex for: 
- Front-end developers who like to write clean markup, and who want to build websites where the CMS doesn't dictate what the templates or site should look like.
- End users that want to focus on producing and editing content, and not on clicking buttons in the CMS.
