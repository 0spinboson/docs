Pilex 
=====

Pilex is a tool for Content Management, which strives to be as simple and straightforward as possible. It is quick to set up, easy to configure, uses elegant templates, and above all: It's a joy to use. Pilex is created using modern Open Source libraries, and is best suited to build sites in HTML5, with modern markup.

Basically, there are three groups of users we've created Pilex for:

 - End users (read 'editors') that want to focus on producing and editing content, and not on clicking buttons in the CMS. 
 - Front-end designers and developers who like to write clean markup, and who want to build websites where the CMS doesn't dictate what the templates or site should look like.
 - Developers who need a system that's easy to set up and configure, that's easy to manage and maintain, but is also flexible and versatile.

To use Pilex as a content editor, you don't have to know anything about HTML, CSS, PHP or any of the other technical stuff we used to build Pilex. Using Pilex should be about writing and editing content, so that's the focus of Pilex' user interface. Much more information about how Pilex works can be found in the chapter [Using Pilex](/using).

To build sites with Pilex we assume you have the usual Frontender skills: You know HTML/CSS, and have working knowledge about JavaScript so you can implement things like Google Analytics trackers, jQuery plugins and such. To create a working site out of your static HTML, you'll need to know about how Pilex uses Content and Contenttypes, and how to make templates using Twig. Information about those topics can be found in the chapters [Working with Content and Content types](/content) and [Building templates](/templates).

When creating Pilex we wanted to focus on creating something simple, straighforward and enjoyable. If you need to build a site with 'enterprise' features, you'll quickly find that there are better tools. The team behind Pilex is working on PivotX 4, which will be awesome. And otherwise you might look into Drupal or Expression Engine. If, however, you need to build a site without a billion modules or huge datastractures, nothing beats Pilex for ease of use.
