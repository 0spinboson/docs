Code Quality
============

The larger a project gets, the harder it is to maintain a particular code
quality and standard. Every developer has his own coding style and way of doing
things. Although there must be enough space to not force people to do their
work in the way the author(s) of bolt think it should, it's important to set
particular bounds for people to operate within.
