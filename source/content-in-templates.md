Content in templates
====================

Perhaps the thing you'll do most in templates is access records of content. Either by requesting specific content, or implicitly when requesting pages that are the defaults for certain contenttypes. 

Using a {{ record }}
----------------------

The easiest way to see what the contents of a record (or any other variable, for that matter) are, is to use the print() function: 

<pre class="brush: html">
{{ print(record) }}
</pre>

<a href="/files/content-example3.png" class="fancybox"><img src="/files/content-example3.png" width="500"></a>

As you can see in the screenshot, a record of a contenttype is an `object`. There are several benefits to this over a regular `array`. We can access the fields like regular values, but we can also use specific functionality for every object, without the need to define these seperately. 

You can access regular fields in a record like these examples for either a `page` or `entry` record: 
<pre class="brush: html">
{{ page.title }}
{{ page.text }}

Created on {{ entry.datecreated|date('Y-m-d')}}

The contenttype for this entry is {{ entry.contenttype.name }}, 
and it contains {{ entry.contenttype.fields|length }} fields.
</pre>

The real power comes from using the special functions that are defined for every content record. 

To get a link to the content: 
<pre class="brush: html">
Link: &lt;a href="{{ page.link }}">{{ page.title }}&lt;/a> 
</pre>

Get a short excerpt of the record: 

<pre class="brush: html">
&lt;p>{{ page.excerpt(250) }}&lt;/p> 
</pre>

If you're using the 'video' field type, more information about the video is available. To see the values that are stored, use `{{ print(page.video) }}`. To insert the `<embed>`-code for the video, use: 

<pre class="brush: html">
{{ page.video.html }}
</pre>

There's also a special 'responsive' HTML snippet available for videos. To insert it, use the following, and add the required CSS to your stylesheet:

<pre class="brush: html">
{{ page.video.responsive }}
</pre>

<pre class="brush: css">
/**
 * Styles for 'responsive video embeds'
 */
.responsive-video {
  height: 0; padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 67.5%; margin-bottom: 10px; position: relative; overflow: hidden;
}
.responsive-video.vimeo {
  padding-top: 0;
}
.responsive-video.widescreen {
  padding-bottom: 57.25%;
}
.responsive-video embed, .responsive-video iframe, .responsive-video object, .responsive-video video {
  top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;
}
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  .responsive-video {
    padding-top: 0;
  }
}
</pre>

### Gettig the type of a certain field

If you're iterating over an array of record.values, it's sometimes useful to know what type of field you're dealing with. This is where the `fieldkey()` function comes in handy:

<pre class="brush: html">
{% for key,value in record.values %}

  {% if record.fieldtype(key) == "image" %}

      <div class='imageholder-wide'><img src="{{ record.image|thumbnail(800, 600) }}"></div>

  {% elseif record.fieldtype(key) not in ['templateselect'] and value != "" %}

      {{ value }}

  {%  endif %}

{% endfor %}
</pre>


<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Before Bolt 1.0 is released, it'll be possible to create one-to-one and one-to-many relationships between records. The record object will provide access to records that are related to it.</p>


Using {{ records }}
-------------------

The `{{ records }}` array, is basically a set of several content records. When you have a `{{ records }}`array, you can iterate over each of the records to output them as desired. 
In the following example you can see how to get an array of records. You'll notice that in this case it's not actually called `records`, but `pages`. Since it's just a variable name, we can call it whatever we like. After getting the `{{ pages }}` array, we use a simple `for` loop, so we can iterate over each of the seperate `{{ page}}` records. 

<pre class="brush: html">
{% setcontent pages = 'pages/latest/4' %}

{% for page in pages %}

	// Do something with each {{ page }}
	{{ page.title }}

{% endfor %}
</pre>

Because `{{ records }}` is an array, we can use all the regular Twig functionality for arrays. In the previous example we've shown how to iterate over the records using a `for` loop, but you can also do things like the following.

Check how many records there are:

<pre class="brush: html">
{% if pages|length > 0 %} More than 0 records {% endif %} 

{% if pages|length < 5 %} Less than 5 records {% endif %}  

There are exactly {{ pages|length }} records. 
</pre>

[Reverse](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/filters/reverse.html) the array:

<pre class="brush: html">
{% for page in pages|reverse %}

	// Do something with each {{ page }}
	{{ page.title }}

{% endfor %}
</pre>

Or [slice](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/filters/slice.html) the array: 

<pre class="brush: html">
{% set slice = pages|slice(1,3) %}

{% for page in slice %}

	// Do something with {{ page }} 1 through 3 
	{{ page.title }}

{% endfor %}
</pre>

Fetching content
----------------

To get content from the database, you can use the `setcontent` tag. The following example will get the content record with slug 'about' from the 'pages' contenttype:

<pre class="brush: html">
{% setcontent about = 'page/about' %}

{{ print(about) }}
</pre>

There are a lot of options for the `setcontent` tag. Most are optional, and all can be used together any way you'd like. The most basic syntax is: 

<code>
{% setcontent _variable_ = '_contenttype_' %}
</code>

This will set a _variable_ to contain the records of the given _contenttype_. For example: `{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' %}` will set `{{ mypages }}` to an array of all the records in 'pages'.

Normally, you don't need _all_ records, but a subset. You can limit the number of records by using a 'where' clause (more on that below), but often it's easier to use the shortcut Bolt provides. 

If you need a single record, and know its id or slug, you can do this:

<pre class="brush: html">
{# get the page with slug 'about' #}
{% setcontent about = 'page/about' %}

{# get the newsitem with id 12 #}
{% setcontent news = 'news/12' %}
</pre>

If you need the '5 latest pages' or '3 first reviews', there's also a shortcut for that:

<pre class="brush: html">
{% setcontent latestpages = 'pages/latest/5' %}

{{ print(latestpages) }}
</pre>

and: 

<pre class="brush: html">
{% setcontent firstreviews = 'reviews/first/3' %}

{{ print(firstreviews) }}
</pre>

If you need a more specific criteria to select the records on, you can use the `where` clause. The parameters must be listed as a hash, so you can include more than one, if needed.

<pre class="brush: html">
{# get all pages with username 'bob' #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' where { username: 'bob' } %}

{# get all events with eventdate '2012-10-15' #}
{% setcontent myevents = 'events' where { eventdate: '2012-10-15' } %}

</pre>

The above examples selected records based on the parameter being **equal** to the matching field in the available records. It's also possible to use modifiers for the values, to select based on 'smaller than' or 'does not equal' 

<pre class="brush: html">
{# get all pages not created by 'bob' #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' where { username: '!bob' } %}

{# get all events with eventdate before '2012-10-15' #}
{% setcontent myevents = 'pages' where { eventdate: '&lt;2012-10-15' } %}

{# get all books with amountsold over 1,000 #}
{% setcontent mybooks = 'books' where { amountsold: '&gt;1000' } %}

{# get all pages with a title that contains 'ipsum' #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' where { title: '%ipsum%' } %}
</pre>



<p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> When using <code>'&lt;=2012-12-01'</code> Bolt only selects dates before or equal to <code>'2012-12-01 00:00:00'</code>. If you want to include december 1st, use <code>'&lt;2012-12-02'</code>. </p>

The `%like%` option is case-insensitive, and does not take word boundaries into account. So, this last example will return the pages with these titles: 

  - 'Lorum ipsum dolor'
  - 'LORUM IPSUM DOLOR'
  - 'Lorumipsumdolor'
  - 'ipsumdolor'

But not:

  - 'Lorum ips√ºm dolor'
  - 'Lorum ips um dolor'


<p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> When using only one <code>%</code>, Bolt will match only the beginning or the end of the field. For example: <code>'lore%'</code> end <code>'olor%'</code> will both match "Lorem Ipsum Dolor", but <code>'ipsu%'</code> won't. </p>


Like mentioned above, you can add more than one parameter to the where clause:

<pre class="brush: html">
{# get all pages not created by 'pete', and created after july 2012 #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' where { username: '!pete', datecreated: '>2012-07-31' } %}
</pre>

There's no built-in limit to the amount of records returned. It is good practice to limit the maximum number of records, by adding a `limit` clause. 

<pre class="brush: html">
{# get 10 pages created by 'bob' #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' where { username: 'bob' } limit 10 %}
</pre>

The results can be sorted by any of the fields of the contenttype, using the `orderby` clause. You can sort either ascending or descending.


<pre class="brush: html">
{# get 10 pages, sorted alphabetically on title #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' limit 10 orderby 'title' %}

{# get the 10 latest modified pages, sorted datechanged descending #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' limit 10 orderby '-datechanged' %}

</pre>

<h3>One record or multiple records?</h3>

Sometimes Bolt will return one record, and sometimes a set of records. What makes the difference? 

<pre class="brush: html">
{% setcontent mypage = 'page/about' %}
{{ mypage }} {# mypage is one record #}

{% setcontent mypages = 'page/latest/5' %}
{% for mypage in mypages %}
  {{ mypage }} {# mypages is an array, that we can loop #}
{% endfor %}
</pre>

Bolt tries to make an assumption about how you want to use it, based on what you're requesting. By default, an array is returned, unless one of the following is the case:

  - `{% setcontent foo = 'bar/1' %}` or `{% setcontent foo = 'bar/qux' %}`: When requesting one specific record, only one is returned.
  - `{% setcontent foo = 'page' where { .. } %}`: If 'page' is the singular slug of the contenttype 'pages', Bolt assumes you only need one. 

If you use 'limit 1', you will get an array with 1 record. Unless, of course, one of the above criteria was met.

Paging 
------

When you have more records than you'd like to display on one page, you can add paging.

If you want to add paging to your template, add `allowpaging` to your `setcontent` tag, and add a `pager` tag.

<pre class="brush: html">
{% setcontent entries = "entries/latest/3" allowpaging %}

{% for entry in entries %}
    {{ entry.title }}
{% endfor %}

{{ pager() }}
</pre>

If you have more than one block of records that you want to paginate on one page, you can use their names in a parameter to keep them seperate:

<pre class="brush: html">
{% setcontent entries = "entries/latest/3" allowpaging %}

{{ pager('entries') }}

{% setcontent mypages = "pages/latest/6" allowpaging %}

{{ pager('pages') }}

</pre>

You can add an optional parameter do determine how many 'neigbouring' pages are shown in the pager:

<pre class="brush: html">
{{ pager('', 2) }}
or:
{{ pager('', 4) }}
</pre>

By default, Bolt will output a simple yet functional pager. Be sure to add some styles to your CSS to make it look right. These are the default rules: 

<pre class="brush: css">
.pagination {
}

.pagination ul {
    float: left;
    clear: both;
    display: block;
    margin: 8px 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: 1px solid #DDD;
}

.pagination ul li {
    float: left;
    list-style-type: none;
    border-right: 1px solid #DDD;
    padding: 4px 6px;
}

.pagination ul li:last-child {
    border-right: none;
}

.pagination ul li.active {
    font-weight: bold;
    background-color: #CCF;
}

.pagination ul li a {
    text-decoration: none;
}
</pre>

If you'd like to define your own pager from scratch, just copy `/app/view/_sub_pager.twig` to your own `view` folder, and rename it to something like `_sub_mypager.twig`. Then, pass the name as an extra parameter to the `pager` tag:

<pre class="brush: html">
{{ pager('', 3, '_sub_mypager.twig') }}
</pre>
