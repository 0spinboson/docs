Content in templates
====================

Perhaps the thing you'll do most in templates, is access records of content. Either by requesting specific content, or implicitly when requesting pages that are the defaults for certain contenttypes. 


Default routes for content
--------------------------

For example, if you have a 'Pages' contenttype, with 'Page' as a singular_name, your site will automatically have pages like:

  - `http://example.org/pages` - Uses `pages.twig`, and displays several records of contenttype 'Pages'.
  - `http://example.org/page/lorem-ipsum-dolor` - Uses `page.twig`, and displays the record of contenttype 'Pages' with the slug 'lorem-ipsum-dolor'.

Unless specified, Pilex will determine the names of these templates automatically. Both of these default templates can be overridden by defining `template` and `singletemplate` in `contenttypes.yml`. 
If the contenttype has a 'template select' field type, the template can be set on a per-record basis. 

In the default template for a single record, it is available as both `{{ record }}` and also by the name of the singular name. So, in the above example, you can also use `{{ page }}`, without having to set it specifically.
Likewise, in the default template for multiple records, the content is available as `{{ records }}` and also by the name of the contenttype, for example `{{ pages }}`.

Using a {{ record }}
----------------------

The easiest way to see what the contents of a record (or any other variable, for that matter) are, is to use the print() function: 

<pre class="brush: html">
{{ print(record) }}
</pre>

<a href="/files/content-example3.png" class="fancybox"><img src="/files/content-example3.png" width="500"></a>

As you can see in the screenshot, a record of a contenttype is an `object`. There are several benefits to this over a regular `array`. We can access the fields like regular values, but we can also use specific functionality for every object, without the need to define these seperately. 

You can access regular fields in a record like these examples for either a `page` or `entry` record: 
<pre class="brush: html">
{{ page.title }}
{{ page.text }}

Created on {{ entry.datecreated|date('Y-m-d')}}

The contenttype for this entry is {{ entry.contenttype.name }}, 
and it contains {{ entry.contenttype.fields|length }} fields.
</pre>

The real power comes from using the special functions that are defined for every content record. 

To get a link to the content: 
<pre class="brush: html">
Link: &lt;a href="{{ page.link }}">{{ page.title }}&lt;/a> 
</pre>

Get a short excerpt of the record: 

<pre class="brush: html">
&lt;p>{{ page.excerpt(250) }}&lt;/p> 
</pre>



<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Before Pilex 1.0 is released, it'll be possible to create one-to-one and one-to-many relatrionships between records. The record object will provide access to records that are related to it.</p>


Using {{ records }}
-------------------

The `{{ records }}` array, is basically a set of several content records. When you have a `{{ records }}`array, you can iterate over each of the records to output them as desired. 
In the following example you can see how to get an array of records. You'll notice that in this case it's not actually called `records`, but `pages`. Since it's just a variable name, we can call it whatever we like. After getting the `{{ pages }}` array, we use a simple `for` loop, so we can iterate over each of the seperate `{{ page}}` records. 

<pre class="brush: html">
{% setcontent pages = 'pages/latest/4' %}

{% for page in pages %}

	// Do something with each {{ page }}
	{{ page.title }}

{% endfor %}
</pre>

Because `{{ records }}` is an array, we can use all the regular Twig functionality for arrays. In the previous example we've shown how to iterate over the records using a `for` loop, but you can also do things like the following.

Check how many records there are:

<pre class="brush: html">
{% if pages|length > 0 %} More than 0 records {% endif %} 

{% if pages|length < 5 %} Less than 5 records {% endif %}  

There are exactly {{ pages|length }} records. 
</pre>

[Reverse](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/filters/reverse.html) the array:

<pre class="brush: html">
{% for page in pages|reverse %}

	// Do something with each {{ page }}
	{{ page.title }}

{% endfor %}
</pre>

Or [slice](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/filters/slice.html) the array: 

<pre class="brush: html">
{% set slice = pages|slice(1,3) %}

{% for page in slice %}

	// Do something with {{ page }} 1 through 3 
	{{ page.title }}

{% endfor %}
</pre>

Fetching content
----------------

To get content from the database, you can use the `setcontent` tag. The following example will get the content record with slug 'about' from the 'pages' contenttype:

<pre class="brush: html">
{% setcontent about = 'page/about' %}

{{ print(about) }}
</pre>

There are a lot of options for the `setcontent` tag. Most are optional, and all can be used together any way you'd like. The most basic syntax is: 

<code>
{% setcontent _variable_ = '_contenttype_' %}
</code>

This will set a _variable_ to contain the records of the given _contenttype_. For example: `{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' %}` will set `{{ mypages }}` to an array of all the records in 'pages'.

Normally, you don't need _all_ records, but a subset. You can limit the number of records by using a 'where' clause (more on that below), but often it's easier to use the shortcut Bolt provides. 

If you need a single record, and know its id or slug, you can do this:

<pre class="brush: html">
{# get all pages with username 'bob' #}
{% setcontent about = 'page/about' %}

{# get the newsitem with id 12 #}
{% setcontent news = 'news/12' %}
</pre>

If you need the '5 latest pages' or '3 first reviews', there's also a shortcut for that:

<pre class="brush: html">
{% setcontent latestpages = 'pages/latest/5' %}

{{ print(latestpages) }}
</pre>

and: 

<pre class="brush: html">
{% setcontent firstreviews = 'reviews/first/3' %}

{{ print(firstreviews) }}
</pre>

If you need a more specific criteria to select the records on, you can use the `where` clause. The parameters must be listed as a hash, so you can include more than one, if needed.

<pre class="brush: html">
{# get all pages with username 'bob' #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' where { username: 'bob' } %}

{# get all events with eventdate '2012-10-15' #}
{% setcontent myevents = 'events' where { eventdate: '2012-10-15' } %}

</pre>

The above examples selected records based on the parameter being **equal** to the matching field in the available records. It's also possible to use modifiers for the values, to select based on 'smaller than' or 'does not equal' 

<pre class="brush: html">
{# get all pages not created by 'bob' #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' where { username: '!bob' } %}

{# get all events with eventdate before '2012-10-15' #}
{% setcontent myevents = 'pages' where { eventdate: '&lt;2012-10-15' } %}

{# get all books with amountsold over 1,000 #}
{% setcontent mybooks = 'books' where { amountsold: '&gt;1000' } %}

{# get all pages with a title that contains 'ipsum' #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' where { title: '%ipsum%' } %}
</pre>

The `%like%` option is case-insensitive, and does not take word boundaries into account. So, this last example will return the pages with these titles: 

  - 'Lorum ipsum dolor'
  - 'LORUM IPSUM DOLOR'
  - 'Lorumipsumdolor'
  - 'ipsumdolor'

But not:

  - 'Lorum ips√ºm dolor'
  - 'Lorum ips um dolor'

Like mentioned above, you can add more than one parameter to the where clause:

<pre class="brush: html">
{# get all pages not created by 'pete', and created after july 2012 #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' where { username: '!pete', datecreated: '>2012-07-31' } %}
</pre>

There's no built-in limit to the amount of records returned. It is good practice to limit the maximum number of records, by adding a `limit` clause. 

<pre class="brush: html">
{# get 10 pages created by 'bob' #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' where { username: 'bob' } limit 10 %}
</pre>

The results can be sorted by any of the fields of the contenttype, using the `orderby` clause. You can sort either ascending or descending.


<pre class="brush: html">
{# get 10 pages, sorted alphabetically on title #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' limit 10 orderby 'title' %}

{# get the 10 latest modified pages, sorted datechanged descending #}
{% setcontent mypages = 'pages' limit 10 orderby '-datechanged' %}

</pre>
