The Bolt Manifesto
==================

Bolt is a CMS that is steadily growing in popularity, and with that
popularity comes an influx of new users and developers. This document is
our Manifesto: It outlines the goals of Bolt, our motto and our values.
This document also describes how we intend to make sure we will adhere to
these self-imposed rules.

- Our slogan is "**Simple<sup>1</sup>, sophisticated and straightforward**". 
  This embodies everything we strive to do with Bolt: It is as simple as
  possible, but not simpler. It uses sophisticated technology to achieve
  this, and use of the system should be straighforward and evident.
- Bolt aims at **three groups of users**: Editors (content writers and 
  editorial staff), Frontend developers (HTML/CSS specialists and implementers) 
  and Backend developers (coders, devops and sysops). All three are 
  equally important.
- We recognize that Bolt is best suited for medium-sized websites. By
  keeping this in mind, we will make sure that we do not spread ourselves
  too thin.
- We will never add new features, if they detract from any of the points
  mentioned above. If a proposed feature makes the system harder to use,
  it will not be accepted. If a proposed feature is for the benefit of one
  of our groups of users, but disadvantageous to another, it will not be
  accepted.
- We will prevent feature creep: Functionality not essential to Bolt,
  should be implemented as separate extensions.
- Bolt is **Open Source software** and it will always be Open Source
  software. We will never intentionally 'cripple' the system, in order to
  sell extensions.
- Our code should be clean, well-organised and legible. For more 
  information, read about our [coding standards](/code-quality).
- We welcome all types of contributions by our users: be it code,
  documentation or helping out with support for the community.
- We (the developers and users of Bolt) will always promote and maintain a
  **welcoming and inclusive community**. This means that harassment or
  prejudice of any kind, including but not limited to; sexism, homophobia,
  and discrimination on religious or political beliefs, **will not** be
  tolerated in any form.


1: 'Simple' is not to be confused with 'Simplistic'.
