The Bolt Manifest
=================

Bolt is a CMS that is steadily gaining in popularity, and with that
popularity comes an influx of new users and developers. This document is
our Manifesto: It outlines the goals of Bolt, our motto and our values.
This document also describes how we intend to make sure we will adhere to
these self-imposed rules.

- Our slogan is "Simple*1, sophisticated and straightforward". This
  embodies everything we strive to do with Bolt: It is as simple as
  possible, but not simpler. It uses sophisticated technology to achieve
  this, and use of the system should be straighforward and evident.
- Bolt aims at three groups of users: Backend developers (coders, devops
  and sysops), Frontend developers (HTML/CSS specialists, implementors)
  and Editors (content writers, editorial staff). All three are equally
  important
- We recognize that Bolt is best suited for medium sized websites. By
  keeping this in mind, we will make sure that we do not spread ourselves
  to thin.
- We will never add new features, if they detract from any of the points
  mentioned above. If a proposed feature makes the system harder to use,
  it will not be accepted. If a proposed feature is for the benefit of one
  of our three groups of users, but disadvantagous to another, it will not
  be accepted.
- We will prevent feature creep: Functionality not essential to Bolt,
  should be implemented as separate extensions.
- Bolt is and will always be Open Source. Nor will we ever intentionally
  'cripple' the system, in order to sell extensions.
- We welcome all types of contributions by our users: be it code,
  documentation or helping out with support for the community.
- We (the developers and users of Bolt) are making an active effort to be
  a welcoming and inclusive community. Racism, sexism, homophobia and
  misogny are __not__ acceptible.
- We have no political agenda.


*1 Note: Do not confuse 'Simple' with 'Simplistic'.
