Roadmap
=======

The current roadmap for Bolt is as follows:

  - October: Release version 0.7 beta. This will be the first public release.
  - November: Release version 0.8 beta. The major new feature will be plugins/extensions, <del>and user levels will be
    enforced properly</del>.
  - December: Release version 0.9 beta. This version will allow for links/joins between records of different
    contenttypes (ie. if you have contenttypes with 'events' and 'artists', you can link the event to an artist, and
    directly use its data). It'll be possible to select more than one record, to do actions on them. User levels will be enforced properly. 
  - January: Release of version 1.0. From this point on, we'll have a stable release.

Bolt 0.8 is the latest release.
