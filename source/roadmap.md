Roadmap
=======

The current roadmap for Bolt is as follows:

  - October: Release version 0.7 beta. This will be the first public release.
  - November: Release version 0.8 beta. The major new feature will be plugins/extensions, and user levels will be enforced properly.
  - December: Release version 0.9 beta. This version will allow for links/joins between records of different contenttypes (ie. if you have contenttypes with 'events' and 'artists', you can link the event to an artist, and directly use it's data). SQLite and PostgreSQL will be supported. 
  - January: Release of version 1.0. From this point on, we'll have a stable release.
