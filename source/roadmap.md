Roadmap
=======

The current roadmap for Bolt is as follows:

Bolt 1.3 (released 2013-11-07)
------------------------------
Bolt 1.3 is the latest stable release. 

Bolt 1.4 (scheduled for december 2013)
--------------------------------------
We're working on version 1.4 now. See the [current issues for 1.4](https://github.com/bolt/bolt/issues?milestone=13) on our github issue tracker gives a more detailed view of what needs to be done. 

Planned features are:

 - Permissions based roles. (read: More userlevels, more options)
 - Support for cron jobs
 - "Save and continue" option in the editor.
 - Support for SSL: Allow (or require) login over HTTPS://


Bolt 2.0 (scheduled for march 2014)
-----------------------------------
After Bolt 1.4, we'll focus on Bolt 2.0. The [issues for 2.0](https://github.com/bolt/bolt/issues?milestone=13) on our github issue tracker gives an overview of tasks planned.

The most important planned features are:

 - Automatic installing and updating of extensions, with a 'marketplace' to find them.
 - New interface for the backend (either in Bootstrap 3 or Foundation 4)
 - JSON-based API for retrieving and updating content in Bolt.
