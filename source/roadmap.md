Roadmap
=======

The current roadmap for Bolt is as follows:

Bolt 1.3 (released November 2013)
------------------------------

Features and bugfixes

Bolt 1.4 (scheduled for december 2013)
--------------------------------------
We're working on version 1.4 now. See the [current issues for 1.4](https://github.com/bolt/bolt/issues?milestone=12) on our github issue tracker gives a more detailed view of what needs to be done. 

Planned features are:

 - Permission-based roles. (read: More userlevels, more options)
 - Support for cron jobs
 - "Save and continue" option in the editor.
 - Support for SSL: Allow (or require) login over HTTPS://
 - Full-page caching

Bolt 1.5 (released February 2014)
---------------------------------

Features and bugfixes


bolt 1.6 (released May 2014)
------------------------------

Features and bugfixes


Bolt 2.0 (scheduled for summer 2014)
-----------------------------------
After Bolt 1.4, we'll focus on Bolt 2.0. The [issues for 2.0](https://github.com/bolt/bolt/issues?milestone=13) on our github issue tracker gives an overview of tasks planned.

 - New interface for the backend (in Bootstrap 3)
 - JSON-based API for retrieving and updating content in Bolt.

Bolt 2.1 (scheduled for autumn 2014)
-----------------------------------
The most important planned features are:

 - Automatic installing and updating of extensions, with a 'marketplace' to find them.


Not scheduled
-------------
Some features are requested often, but are not currently scheduled. This is because we either consider them "out of scope" or that we know it would take up too much resources, affecting the overall development of Bolt in a negative way. That does _not_ mean that these issues will not be implemented, it only means that they're not currently scheduled. If you absolutely need any of these features for a project you're working on, feel free to get in touch at [commercialsupport@bolt.cm](mailto:commercialsupport@bolt.cm). 

  - Native support for Multi-lingual content in the frontend. See [#234](http://github.com/bolt/bolt/issues/234)
  - Hierarchical (tree) structure for content.


Previous milestones
-------------------

  - October 2012: Release version 0.7 beta. This will be the first public release.
  - November 2012: Release version 0.8 beta. The major new feature will be plugins/extensions, <del>and user levels will be enforced properly</del>.
  - December 2012: Release version 0.9 beta. This version will allow for links/joins between records of different
    contenttypes (ie. if you have contenttypes with 'events' and 'artists', you can link the event to an artist, and
    directly use its data). It'll be possible to select more than one record, to do actions on them. User levels will be enforced properly. 
  - January 2013: Release of version 1.0. From this point on, we'll have a stable release.
  - June 2013: Bolt 1.1 released.
  - September 2013: Bolt 1.2 released.
