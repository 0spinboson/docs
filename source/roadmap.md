Previous milestones
-------------------

  - October 2012: Release version 0.7 beta. This will be the first public release.
  - November 2012: Release version 0.8 beta. The major new feature will be plugins/extensions, <del>and user levels will be enforced properly</del>.
  - December 2012: Release version 0.9 beta. This version will allow for links/joins between records of different
    contenttypes (ie. if you have contenttypes with 'events' and 'artists', you can link the event to an artist, and
    directly use its data). It'll be possible to select more than one record, to do actions on them. User levels will be enforced properly. 
  - January 2013: Release of version 1.0. From this point on, we'll have a stable release.
