Updating Bolt
=============

As with all web-based applications, it's good practice to keep your site up to date with the latest version. Bolt is built in such a way, that none of the files that are used for the configuration are included in the distribution files. In practice, this means that upgrading Bolt works in exactly the same way as installing a new copy of bolt.
