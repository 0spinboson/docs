The traditional way, using (S)FTP
=================================

Download the [latest version of Bolt](http://bolt.cm/distribution/bolt-latest.zip).

Extract the .zip file, and upload to your webhost using the (S)FTP client of 
your choice.

**Note:** Don't forget to upload the <code>.htaccess</code> file! Bolt won't 
work without it. 

If you can't find the file on your file system, download this 
[<code>default.htaccess</code>](http://bolt.cm/distribution/default.htaccess)
file. 

Upload it to your server, and then rename it to <code>.htaccess</code>.

If you're on OSX and you don't see the file, it might be that your system is 
set up to 'hide' hidden files.

You can usually still find it, when browsing local files using your FTP
client.

you require guidance on setting up permissions, see our [File System Permissions](permissions)
