Installing Bolt
===============

This page explains the various ways of installing Bolt. You can either use the
command-line or your FTP-client to install it. There are three ways to install
Bolt:

  - The easiest way, [from the command-line](#option-1-easy-way-using-command-line).
  - The traditional way, [using (S)FTP](#option-2-traditional-way-using-sftp).
  - The nerdy way, [for developers](#option-3-developer-way-using-git-and-composer).

Use one of the three methods described below to get the Bolt source files, and
set them up on your webserver. After you've done this, skip to the section for
[Setting up Bolt ](#setting-bolt).
