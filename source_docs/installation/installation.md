Installing Bolt
===============

This page explains the various ways of installing Bolt. You can either use the
command-line or your FTP-client to install it. 

There are several ways to install Bolt:

  - The easiest way, [from the command-line](install-command-line).
  - The traditional way, [using (S)FTP](install-sftp).
  - The nerdy way, [for developers](install-composer).
  - The core contributor, [for Bolt core development](install-git-clone).

Use one of the three methods described below to get the Bolt source files, and
set them up on your webserver. After you've done this, skip to the section for
[Setting up Bolt ](#setting-bolt).
